A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/geekypraveen/pen/PWQaZp.

 This is Random Quote Generator Web Application which I created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, JSON & Twitter Api.

 You can Click on the button 'Get a quote' which will select a random quote from the list of JSON data called through api & display it on the screen. By pressing the button again, it will update the quote with new one.
Also, you can post the quote on twitter using the button 'Tweet Me' located below the quote.
